For the creation of the dataset some things were modified:
- Patches are taken from images and videos
- to detect motion the histrogram is used between couples of images
- the parametrization is done by hand
- more than one patch is taken from an image
- frames are taken every n seconds to increase diversity
- videos are chosen with 480p resolution, so the motion in a patch is not too large
  also are chosen to have focus on all moving things, to not get blur and the motion is not too large
- Images are randomly cropped from videos, so they are not re cropped from 150 to 128 pixels
- Modificate le funzioni train e valutazione per rendere il codice più leggibile (si spera)
- Rimossa la metrica di accuracy e aggiunta quella di PSNR
- Aggiunta la possibilità di avere il numero totale di parametri
